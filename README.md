# Binanciator

## Real basic Python script, uses the binance API to get a vague idea of your profits, losses, good and bad investments

### Just pull, set your binance API keys up, your full initial ivestment and you're good to go!

#### This was a first at attempting python w/ a  REST api, shall be tweaked as time goes on.

**Note that this program uses BUSD as a secondary pair, not USDT or anything else.
