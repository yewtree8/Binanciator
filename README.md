# Binanciator

## Real basic Python script, uses the binance API to get a vague idea of your profits, losses, good and bad investments

### Just pull, add to the config, you're good to go!

#### This was a first at attempting python w/ a  REST api, shall be tweaked as time goes on.

**Note that this program uses BUSD as a secondary pair, not USDT or anything else.


## V1.1 Update
- Config files with YAML??
- Even slower than before.
- Improved and more accurate pricing calculations
- Lots of lil tweaks.
- Will make a memory management unit next version.
- Fixed menu loop bug
